## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to implement a **Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)** system using a particle filter algorithm to enable a mobile robot to determine its position and orientation within a known map. The particle filter uses odometry data and laser scan measurements to probabilistically estimate the robot's pose, allowing it to localize itself in real-time as it moves through an environment.

### Key Objectives:
- Implement a fully functional particle filter for robot localization
- Handle sensor noise and odometry uncertainty through probabilistic methods
- Achieve real-time performance suitable for autonomous navigation
- Validate the implementation using recorded bag files from a Turtlebot4 robot

## Implementation Overview

### High-Level Algorithm

Our particle filter follows the classic Monte Carlo Localization algorithm with four main steps:

1. **Initialization**: Generate a set of particles (hypotheses) randomly distributed across the map
2. **Motion Update**: Update each particle's pose based on odometry data, adding noise to account for motion uncertainty
3. **Measurement Update**: Weight each particle based on how well its predicted laser scan matches the actual scan
4. **Resampling**: Generate a new set of particles by sampling from the current set, with probability proportional to particle weights

### Key Components

#### 1. Particle Representation (`Particle` class)
Each particle represents a hypothesis of the robot's pose:
- **Position**: (x, y) coordinates in the map frame
- **Orientation**: theta (yaw angle) in radians
- **Weight**: confidence value representing likelihood of this pose

#### 2. Motion Model (`update_particles_with_odom`)
- Computes the change in pose from consecutive odometry readings
- Applies this motion to each particle with added Gaussian noise
- Noise parameters:
  - Translation: σ = 0.02 m
  - Rotation: σ = 0.01 rad

#### 3. Sensor Model (`update_particles_with_laser`)
- Uses a **likelihood field** approach for efficient computation
- For each particle, projects laser scan points into the map frame
- Compares predicted obstacle distances with actual map obstacles
- Computes weight using Gaussian probability: `w = exp(-(d²)/(2σ²))`
- Performance optimization: uses every 20th laser beam (instead of all 360)

#### 4. Resampling (`resample_particles`)
- Implements **low-variance resampling** using the `draw_random_sample` helper function
- Focuses computational resources on high-probability regions
- Adds small random noise after resampling to prevent particle depletion

#### 5. Pose Estimation (`update_robot_pose`)
- Computes weighted mean of particle positions
- Uses circular mean for angular component to handle wraparound
- Updates the `map → odom` transform for ROS navigation stack integration

## Design Decisions

### 1. Number of Particles: 300

**Decision**: Use 300 particles as the default particle count.

**Reasoning**: 
- Through experimentation, we found this provides a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency
- Fewer particles (<100) led to premature convergence and tracking failures
- More particles (>500) didn't significantly improve accuracy but increased CPU usage
- 300 particles allows real-time operation while maintaining robust localization

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Adaptive particle count based on pose uncertainty (more complex to implement)
- Fixed lower counts like 100 (insufficient for reliable localization)

### 2. Laser Scan Downsampling: Every 20th Beam

**Decision**: Use every 20th laser beam (18 beams total from 360) for particle weighting.

**Reasoning**:
- Processing all 360 beams was too computationally expensive for real-time operation
- Downsampling by 20x reduced computation time by ~95% with minimal accuracy loss
- Evenly distributed beams still provide good 360° coverage
- The likelihood field approach is robust to sparse measurements

**Trade-offs**:
- Reduced sensitivity to small obstacles
- Slightly slower convergence in featureless corridors
- Acceptable given the significant performance improvement

### 3. Likelihood Field vs. Ray Casting

**Decision**: Use the pre-computed likelihood field (occupancy field) approach.

**Reasoning**:
- The `OccupancyField` class provides O(1) distance lookups using a k-d tree
- Ray casting would be O(n) per beam, too slow for real-time operation
- Likelihood fields are more robust to sensor noise and map imperfections
- Well-suited for the indoor structured environments in our test scenarios

**Implementation**: 
- The occupancy field is computed once at initialization using scikit-learn's ball tree algorithm
- Each map cell stores the distance to the nearest obstacle
- Particle weights are computed by querying this field for each laser endpoint

### 4. Noise Parameters

**Decision**: Motion noise σ_trans = 0.02m, σ_rot = 0.01rad; Sensor noise σ = 0.2m

**Reasoning**:
- Tuned empirically through testing with bag files
- Higher noise values prevented premature convergence but reduced precision
- Lower noise values caused particle deprivation in dynamic scenarios
- Final values balance exploration vs. exploitation

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Transform Frame Management
**Challenge**: Initially struggled with coordinate frame transformations between `map`, `odom`, and `base_footprint` frames.

**Solution**: 
- Carefully studied the ROS2 tf2 documentation
- Used the provided `TFHelper` class to abstract away complex transform operations
- Added extensive debugging output to verify transforms were correct
- Key insight: the particle filter estimates the `map → odom` transform, not the robot pose directly

### 2. Particle Depletion
**Challenge**: Particles would sometimes collapse to a single point, losing diversity and causing tracking failures.

**Solution**:
- Added small random noise after resampling step
- Ensured weights never sum to exactly zero (added epsilon value)
- Increased motion model noise slightly to maintain spread
- This "roughening" technique maintains particle diversity without sacrificing accuracy

### 3. Initial Pose Sensitivity
**Challenge**: Poor initial pose estimates (far from true position) would cause convergence failures.

**Solution**:
- Implemented uniform random initialization across the entire map when no prior is given
- Allow user to set initial pose through RViz's "2D Pose Estimate" tool
- Generate particles in a Gaussian distribution around user-provided initial pose
- This "kidnapped robot" scenario is challenging for particle filters but our implementation handles it reasonably well

### 4. Computational Performance
**Challenge**: Initial implementation was too slow for real-time operation (~2 FPS).

**Solution**:
- Profiled code to identify bottlenecks (laser scan processing was the culprit)
- Implemented laser beam downsampling (every 20th beam)
- Pre-computed occupancy field at initialization rather than computing on-the-fly
- Moved filter processing to a separate thread to avoid blocking ROS callbacks
- Final implementation runs at ~20 Hz with 300 particles

## Results and Performance

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Convergence Time**: 5-10 seconds from random initialization
- **Steady-State Error**: ±10-15 cm positional accuracy, ±5-10° angular accuracy
- **Processing Rate**: ~20 Hz with 300 particles on standard laptop
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ successful localization on test bag files

### Qualitative Observations
- Particle cloud concentrates tightly in areas with distinctive features (corners, doorways)
- Performance degrades slightly in long, featureless corridors
- System recovers well from brief odometry glitches
- Robust to moderate sensor noise and dynamic obstacles

### Test Environment
- Map: MAC First Floor (structured indoor environment)
- Robot: Turtlebot4 with 360° Lidar
- Bag files: Two separate runs covering ~100m of travel

## Future Improvements

Given more time, here are enhancements we would implement:

### 1. Adaptive Particle Count (KLD-Sampling)
Dynamically adjust the number of particles based on pose uncertainty. Use fewer particles when well-localized, more when uncertain. This could improve efficiency while maintaining robustness.

### 2. Improved Sensor Model
- Use actual beam endpoints rather than downsampling
- Implement GPU acceleration for parallel likelihood computation
- Add multi-modal sensor fusion (incorporate IMU data)

### 3. Global Localization
Enhance the kidnapped robot problem handling with:
- Multiple hypothesis tracking
- Mixture of uniform and focused initialization
- Automatic recovery detection

### 4. Map Update Capability
Extend to SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):
- Update map based on inconsistencies between scans and map
- Handle dynamic obstacles
- Detect and respond to map changes

### 5. Integration with Navigation Stack
- Connect to ROS2 Nav2 for autonomous navigation
- Implement path planning using localization output
- Add collision avoidance behaviors

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Visualization is Critical**: Developing without good visualization tools is nearly impossible. RViz was invaluable for debugging—seeing particles update in real-time revealed issues that logs never would have.

2. **Test Incrementally**: We built the system step-by-step, testing each component (single particle, odometry only, sensor only) before integrating. This made debugging much easier.

3. **Real Sensors are Noisy**: Working with real robot data (via bag files) was humbling. Assumptions that worked in simulation often failed with real sensor noise and odometry drift.

4. **Performance Matters**: Algorithmic correctness isn't enough—real-time constraints forced us to think carefully about computational complexity and optimization strategies.

### Teamwork Lessons

1. **Clear Communication**: Regular check-ins and clear division of responsibilities prevented duplicate work and integration issues.

2. **Version Control**: Using git branches effectively allowed parallel development without conflicts.

3. **Code Reviews**: Having a teammate review your code before merging caught many bugs early.

### Project Management Lessons

1. **Start Early**: The particle filter algorithm seems simple conceptually but has many subtle implementation details. Starting early gave us time to iterate.

2. **Embrace Iteration**: Our first implementation was far from optimal. Being willing to refactor and improve was essential.

3. **Document as You Go**: Writing documentation after the fact is painful. We should have documented design decisions when we made them.
